# CVE Analysis

CVE analysis is **one road of many** that leads to the identification and comprehension of [vulnerability classes](Vulnerability%20Classes.md) and  discovery.

## Strategy

The analysis of a CVE will grant experience with the specific software that contains the reported vulnerability. As the component is analyzed, it will highlight the current problem and help put you in the context to identify other areas the same problem might exist ([variant analysis](https://blog.semmle.com/intro_to_variant_analysis_part_1/)). The analysis of several CVEs within the same software can help to generalize common security issues or vulnerability classes found within a particular system.  

### Learn about Vulnerability Classes

> A **vulnerability class** is a set of vulnerabilities that share some unifying commonality pattern or concept that isolates a specific feature shared by several different software flaws -TAOSSA

Fundamental understanding of [vulnerability classes](Vulnerability%20Classes.md)  expands a researchers ability to find similar vulnerabilities in the current context of research and more generally, find the same type of vulnerability in other places (software).  Vulnerability classes establish mental models that help researchers identify subtle security flaws, providing new lenses by which out of to approach various auditing tasks.

As you study CVEs, your knowledge of vulnerability classes will increase. As your set of known vulnerability classes increases, your ability to discover vulnerabilities should grow in proportion. You can only find what you can see. 

### The Ideal Process

The high level idea is to :
1. Research relevant CVEs
2. Perform analysis (CVE and Patch Diffing) to reach a sufficient level of understanding. 
3. Leverage the knowledge gained throughout the process to discover new or related vulnerabilities.

#### Windows Print Spooler Ideal Process 

This section takes you through CVE analysis of several CVEs that will lead to discovering vulnerability classes and a better understanding of why the Windows Print Spooler recently reported several CVEs. 

This is an ideal picture of the full process.

Let's begin with CVE analysis. 

## Example CVE analysis

Following along from our [research](Research.md), we will continue looking at CVEs from the *Windows Print Spooler*.  Those linked below provide sample CVE analysis.  Those selected were CVEs with plenty of public documentation, making the total analysis time minimal (~2-3 hours). If the CVE you seek lacks public research, [patch difffing](Patch%20Diffing.md) and further [analysis](Patch%20Analysis.md) may be your Obi-Wan Kenobi (only hope) for understanding.

This list was pulled in Jan 2021 searching "Windows Print Spooler" (mostly*) then reduced the list to those CVEs that had at least one public blog post or code sample. 

|Name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|[CVE-2021-1678](CVE-2021-1678.md)|*NTLM Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability*| 
|[CVE-2020-17001](CVE-2020-17001.md)|Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-17014.|

|[CVE-2010-2729](CVE-2010-2729.md)|The Print Spooler service in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold, SP2, and R2, and Windows 7, when printer sharing is enabled, does not properly validate spooler access permissions, which allows remote attackers to create files in a system directory, and consequently execute arbitrary code, by sending a crafted print request over RPC, as exploited in the wild in September 2010, aka "Print Spooler Service Impersonation Vulnerability."|
<sub>* Note:  While the search results from the search on Mitre's CVE search page is effective, **it is not comprehensive**. The CVE-2021-1678 was pulled into this analysis as it is another vulnerability that links to CVE-2020-1048. This CVE was found from prior reading a security blogs and manually linked to the Windows Print Spooler. </sub>

### What It Is and Isn't

![analysis_defined](Resources/images/analysis_defined.PNG)

CVE analysis isn't magic. There is no perfect set of steps to follow for full understanding of a particular CVE. For each of the linked analyses above, a basic analysis was perform using a predefined template.  The analysis wasn't too complicated or long.  It was mostly taking time to think about various security related topics as they pertained specifically to [Windows Print Spooler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/printdocs/print-spooler) and various [security boundaries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/windows-security-servicing-criteria). Identifying the vulnerability classes, either explicitly stated or implied, in the public blogs and code samples.  And finally, asking questions, making connections, and attempting to *understand* by digging a bit deeper than simply *reading* a blog post. 

CVE analysis is difficult to teach, at least without first trying it. It most likely will make the most sense when trying to answer some of the questions yourself.  If you are new to security research, sometimes some guard rails are helpful to keep you on track. To provide the rails a template is presented to guide your study of the CVEs and offer some hints for points of comparison to later be generalized in the development of your understanding. 

Take a moment to read through some of the CVE analyses above before moving on to the explanation of the template. 

### CVE Analysis Template

To help with the CVE analysis process, a standardized template can be helpful.

<sub>CVE Analysis Template</sub>

This is quite a bit all at once.  Before digesting, let's talk about some of the pros of using a template. Then walk through the process of filling in the template for CVE-1048-2020.

#### Why use a template? 
1. *A Path to Follow* - A template helps remove the guesswork of analysis. It provides a standard set of concepts and attributes to consider and helps a researcher focus the important aspects as related to the vulnerability. 
2. *Efficiency through Standardization* - As the process becomes familiar, the speed of analysis increases.  With experience comes the ability to pick out the relevant information. With this (or [another](Resources/Google's%20Project%20Zero%20Template.md)) prescribed template, the concepts to watch for are clear. 

### Filling It In For CVE-1048-2020

To  reduce frustration, let's walk through the thought process of CVE analysis for CVE-2020-1048.  We will walk through the primary sections and base all of the answer on [this detailed post](https://windows-internals.com/printdemon-cve-2020-1048/).  

#### Metadata Primer
*data about your data providing context for the CVE*

At the top of the template is the metadata section.  This section can help to categorize the CVEs, provide an easy way to go back and find relevant information, and give relational context to other CVEs.  

##### Legend
- **CVE #**:   *CVE-YYYY-####* 
- **Related CWE(s)**:  *Related Vulnerability Classes* 
-** Related CVE(s)**:  *list of CVEs that relate to this instance*
- **created**: *2021-01-29*
- **title**: *self created or internet deemed title*
- **web**:  *list of reference blog links related to the CVE* 
- **platform**: *Windows/Android/ios/etc* 
- **descriptor tags**:  *\#hastagsToDescribeCVE*

##### CWEs??

CWE stands for **common weakness enumeration**.  Yet another community list helping to identify and categorize various types of vulnerabilities. The easiest way to explain the difference is to contrast CWE with CVE. 

A CVE ID (**common vulnerability and exposure**) is an instance of a particular vulnerability. (ie CVE-2020-1048)  A CWE (**common weakness enumeration**) is the category that a vulnerability fits in, it's type or [vulnerability class](Vulnerability%20Classes.md). 

Also, see [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md) for more details.

#### Metadata for CVE-2020-1048

	- descriptor tags: #cve #security #printers 


```

Some of the metadata is straightforward (date, web links, ID) and some are more subtle. 

#### CWEs

The most difficult metadata bullet.  The goal is to identify the vulnerability classes that relate to the particular CVE. Labeling a CVE helps you to think about the specific vulnerability class and it's realtionship in the context of your CVE. For CVE-2020-1048, two vulnerability classes were made explicit in the blog. 

> ### Client Side Port Check Vulnerability 
> Yes, it was that simple. The UI dialog has a client-side check… the server, does not. And PowerShell’s WMI Print Provider Module… does not. [](https://windows-internals.com/printdemon-cve-2020-1048/)

> ### Self Impersonation Privilege Escalation (SIPE) 
> The Spooler is impersonating… SYSTEM! It seems the code was never written to handle a situation that would arise where a user might have logged out, or rebooted, or simply the Spooler crashing, and now we can write anywhere SYSTEM can. Indeed, looking at the NT4 source code, the PrintDocumentThruPrintProcessor function just zooms through and writes into the port.[](https://windows-internals.com/printdemon-cve-2020-1048/)

To standardize, match specific [CWEs](https://cwe.mitre.org/) to the identified  vulnerabilities classes. Here are the matches listed respectively:

- [Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime \- (664)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/664.html)
	- [Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres \- (669)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/669.html)
		- [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security \- (602)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/602.html)
- [Improper Access Control \- (284)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)
	- [Improper Privilege Management \- (269)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)
		- [Privilege Context Switching Error \- (270)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/270.html)

Supply not only the direct matches (CWE-602 and CWE-270), but parent CWEs (parent CWEs generally being a more abstract version of the child). Explicitly mapping out the CWEs in this way can help a reaseacher identify relationships to other CVEs at a different level of abstraction. This is a convention that helps a novice researcher classify vulnerability classes and better understand their relationships.  

#### Main Content - CVE-2020-1048

Now that the metadata is out of the way, time to tackle the main content of the template. Don't go overboard here, but try to think and answer each question with the information that is available. 

##### Summary

In your own words,  summarize the primary details of the vulnerability. 

```markdown
>*PrintDemon is an elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability that exists in the Windows Print Spooler service as it improperly allows arbitrary file writing on the file system [](https://voidsec.com/cve-2020-1337-printdemon-is-dead-long-live-printdemon/)*

A local user can craft an print job (via a SHD file) which contains arbitrary data and an arbitrary file path as `SYSTEM`.  This occurs because of two primary reasons. 
- There are specific security checks that exist on the client side when adding a printer port that are missing on the server side, and those checks can be circumvent. 
- The print spooler, when writing the file to disk creates and writes the file as the `SYSTEM` user if the impersonation token has no context. 
```

##### Components Affected

Depending on your platform, which software  are affected by the CVE? Does   File I/O or sharing? Network authentication? Access check?


##### Security Boundaries

##### Hashtags

Depening on your software, this is very subjective. 

##### Requirements

This is a great topic for increasing your skill. What was required to make this CVE a reality? What didn't the devleper consider? What played a major role? What stars needed to align??

### Getting to the Root Cause

As you approach the Root Cause section of the [Template for CVE analysis](Templates/Template%20for%20CVE%20analysis.md), there are several things to keep in mind. The idea is to determine the underlying security issue that caused the vulnerability. Sometimes this is clear from the various blog post and CVE write ups and other times clarity will only come from digging deeper with [patch diffing](Patch%20Diffing.md). It's best to get a good understanding of the [root cause](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md) to position ourselves to either find other ways to reach the vulnerability.

#### Fundamental Issue / Root Cause Section

>Armchair theorizing, armchair philosophizing, or armchair scholarship is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing)  #removethis?

Understanding the fundamental issue gives us a stepping stone to the reason as to why any particular CVE exists in the first place.  Until the root issue is addressed,**security remains a concern**.  In this section of the template, initially provide an [armchair theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing) about the fundamental issue. There is a bit of a chicken and egg situation here, you can't really know the root issue until you dig a little deeper.  To dig a little deeper an analyst can apply both [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md) and  further clarify with [Patch Diffing](Patch%20Diffing.md). 


#### Best Fit Vulnerability Class (or CWE) Section

*Best fit vulnerability class* is the main category that the particular CVE instance aligns with. Sometimes a vulnerability can span multiple, but that can be fleshed out in the summary and previous section. The idea behind this section is to determine the best fit. For those with more experience, a simple "use-after-free" reference might be enough. The novice researcher would do best to take a look at the [CWE](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md) list, providing some rails on which to categorize the particular CVE. Arguably, this practice can help form links to new ideas about vulnerabilities (Vulnerability Class ideation) and increase overall comprehension.  

#### "Is this CVE the Root Cause or a Causal Factor?" Section

The answer to this question is often more subtle than expected.  To really get the root cause, we take a look at [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md) in the next section.








#### Several Roads to Rome

There are alternate templates.  In July of 2020 Googe's Project zero shared a template for root cause analysis. They also keep a spreadsheet to summarize their findings across the years. See [Resources/Google's Project Zero Template](Resources/Google's%20Project%20Zero%20Template.md). What is most important is that you have a process that works for you. 


## Seeking Patterns
Finding patterns and vulnerability classes takes time. Reviewing several CVEs for a particular piece of software should help connect some dots by defining the requirements needed to enact the vulnerabilities. The more you can observe, the more likely a pattern will emerge.  As you being to become familiar with a particular software component, it will be easier to notice the security relevant areas of the software. 

Simply reviewing the [CVE search result](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Windows+print+spooler) table's text can give you some hint without looking any further. You can see that this is a Windows **service**, likely running at an **elevated** **privelege**, accessible by **RPC** and able to **write** **arbitrary** **files**.

### Seeking Patterns in CVE Analysis Templates

Reading some of the filled in CVE analyses above, you can begin to get a feel for the vulnerabilities within the Windows Printer Spooler.  Generalizing patterns from within the various sections can help you see clearer. 

![](Resources/images/cve-analysis-graph.png)


Leveraging several **sections** from the template across multiple CVEs, patterns emerge. 

#### Summary Section

- Arbitrary file write as `SYSTEM` leading to code execution
	- [CVE-2010-2729](CVE-2010-2729.md#Summary)
	- [CVE-2020-1048](CVE-2020-1048.md#Summary)
	- [CVE-2020-1337](CVE-2020-1337.md#Summary)
	- [CVE-2020-17001](CVE-2020-17001.md#Summary)
	- [CVE-2021-1678](CVE-2021-1678.md#Summary)

#### Security Boundaries Section

- **User** - A user cannot access or tamper with the code and data of another user without being authorized. 
	- [CVE-2010-2729](CVE-2010-2729.md#Security%20Boundaries)
	- [CVE-2020-1048](CVE-2020-1048.md#Security%20Boundaries)
	- [CVE-2020-1337](CVE-2020-1337.md#Security%20Boundaries)
	- [CVE-2020-17001](CVE-2020-17001.md#Security%20Boundaries)
	- [CVE-2021-1678](CVE-2021-1678.md#Security%20Boundaries)
- **Network boundary** - An unauthorized network endpoint cannot access or tamper with the code and data on a customer’s device.
	- [CVE-2010-2729](CVE-2010-2729.md#Security%20Boundaries)
	- [CVE-2021-1678](CVE-2021-1678.md#Security%20Boundaries)

#### Requirements Section
- User context - running code as user
- Networked / Shared Printer
- Controlling State 
	- ability to (start/stop/resume print jobs)
	- TOCTOU

#### Insights 

From the CVE analysis, some general insights emerge:
- The Windows Print Spooler is a popular target because it is running as `SYSTEM` and can easily be interacted with from a standard user via Win32 APIs over RPC.  
- The Windows Printer Spooler performs several privileged file operations and is subject to Time of Check Time of Use Vulnerabilities. 
- The Windows Printer Spooler is also subject to network attacks via its HTTP component.

From repeated CVE analysis you can begin to understand the complexity (service,user,network) of this system. The entry points and attack surface (APIs). Clarity about particular security relevant sections (authentication, files writes) start to become clear.  And finally, a general idea about which vulnerability classes (CWEs and more generally TOCTOU, race condition).



## When to stop

There is no such thing as a perfect analysis. **There isn't enough time or resources to provide complete comprehension.**  It's OK to not fill in the template completely. This process details a repeatable analysis to be applied with consideration to the *time* and *resources* available.

The **hope** is that CVE analysis would be a repeatable process to increase comprehension of a specific vulnerability and vulnerability classes, that would lead to further competence in vulnerability research, that would culminate in new discovery and insight.   

```mermaid

graph LR;

A[CVE Analysis] --> B[Comprehension / Familiarity];
B --> C[Competence];
C --> D[Discovery];

```

### Positive Feedback Loop
Ideally, this process puts the researcher into a self-sustaining positive feedback loop that motivates the researcher to enjoy the work, improve competence, and repeat the cycle on their journey from novice to expert. 
```mermaid

graph LR;

A[Postive Experience] --> B[Take On Next Task With Ease];

## Next

Next, we will take a look at [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md), to ensure we are asking enough questions to get to the underlying issue.  After that we will then try [Patch Diffing](Patch%20Diffing.md) to fill in some of the gaps and provide further clarity.
