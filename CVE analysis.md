# CVE Analysis

CVE analysis is **one road of many** that leads to the identification and comprehension of [vulnerability classes](Vulnerability%20Classes.md) and vulnerability discovery.

## Strategy

The analysis of a CVE will grant experience with the specific software that contains the reported vulnerability. As the component is analyzed, it will highlight the current problem and help put you in the context to identify the same problem in in the same component, or within other components within the system. 

The analysis of several CVEs within the same software can help to generalize vulnerability classes found within the system.  This is demonstrated below in the [Example CVE analysis](#Example%20CVE%20analysis) section. 

### Learn about Vulnerability Classes

> A **vulnerability class** is a set of vulnerabilities that share some unifying commonality pattern or concept that isolates a specific feature shared by several different software flaws

Fundamental understanding of [vulnerability classes](Vulnerability%20Classes.md)  expands a researchers ability to find similar vulnerabilities in the current context of research and more generally, find the same type of vulnerability in other places (software).  Vulnerability classes establish mental models that help researchers identify subtle security flaws, providing new lenses by which out of to approach various auditing tasks.

As you study CVEs, your knowledge of vulnerability classes will increase. As your set of known vulnerability classes increases, your ability to discover vulnerabilities should grow in proportion. You can only find what you can see. 

### The Ideal Process

The high level idea is to :
1. Research relevant CVEs
2. Perform CVE analysis and Patch Differential Analysis to reach a sufficient level of understanding. 
3. Leverage the knowledge gained throughout the process to discover new or related vulnerabilities.

#### Windows Print Spooler Ideal Process 

This section attempts to take you through CVE analysis of several CVEs that will lead to discovering vulnerability classes and a better understanding of why the Windows Print Spooler recently reported several CVEs. 

This is an ideal picture of the process.

## CVE Analysis Template

To help with the CVE analysis process, a standardized template can be helpful. Here is a suggested template. 

```markdown
tags: #cve-analysis

- metadata
	- CVE #:  
	- Related CWE(s):
	- Related CVE(s):
	- created: 2021-02-03
	- title:
	- web:  
	- platform:
	- descriptor tags: #cve #security 


# CVE-####-####

## Summary

## Components affected

## Security Boundaries 
*which [security boundaries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/windows-security-servicing-criteria) have been crossed? **

##  Hashtags
*connect CVE to a specific topic, event, theme or concept*

## Requirements
*what stars needed to align?*

## Fundamental Issue / Root Cause

### Best Fit Vulnerability Class (or CWE) for *this* CVE

### Is this CVE the Root Cause or a Causal Factor?

Choose **one**:
- **root cause** - *underlying issue or fundamental reason of a problem or issue*
- **causal factor** - *major contributor to an undesirable condition that if eliminated, would have either prevented the occurrence of the incident or reduced its severity or frequency*

## Patch Info

### Version
- Date
- Link 

### Treating a Symptom or Cure?


```

### Why use a template? 
1. *A Path to Follow* - A template helps remove the guesswork of analysis. It provides a standard set of concepts and attributes to consider and helps a researcher focus the important aspects as related to the vulnerability. 
2. *Efficiency through Standardization* - As the process becomes familiar, the speed of analysis increases.  With experience comes the ability to pick out the relevant information. With this (or [another](Resources/Google's%20Project%20Zero%20Template.md)) prescribed template, the concepts to watch for are clear. 

### Metadata Primer
*data about your data providing context for the CVE*

At the top of the template is the metadata section.  This section can help to categorize the CVEs, provide an easy way to go back and find relevant information, and give relational context to other CVEs.  

- **CVE #**:   *CVE-YYYY-####* 
- **Related CWE(s)**:  *Related Vulnerability Classes* 
-** Related CVE(s)**:  *list of CVEs that relate to this instance*
- **created**: *2021-01-29*
- **title**: *self created of internet deemed title*
- **web**:  *list of reference blog links related to the CVE* 
- **platform**: *Windows/Android/ios/etc* 
- **descriptor tags**:  *\#hastagsToDescribeCVE*

### CWEs??

CWE stands for **common weakness enumeration**.  Yet another community list helping to identify and categorize various types of vulnerabilities. The easiest way to explain the difference is to contrast CWE with CVE. 

A CVE ID (**common vulnerability and exposure**) is an instance of a particular vulnerability. (ie CVE-2020-1048)  A CWE (**common weakness enumeration**) is the category that a vulnerability fits in, it's type or [vulnerability class](Vulnerability%20Classes.md). 

Also, see [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md) for more details. 


### Several Roads to Rome - Other analysis templates

There are alternate templates.  In July of 2020 Googe's Project zero shared a template for root cause analysis. They also keep a spreadsheet to summarize their findings across the years. See [Resources/Google's Project Zero Template](Resources/Google's%20Project%20Zero%20Template.md). What is most important is that you have a template that works for you. 


## Example CVE analysis

![](Resources/images/cve-analysis-graph.png)


Following along from our [research](Research.md), we will continue looking at CVEs from the *Windows Print Spooler*.  Those linked below provide sample CVE analysis.  Those selected were CVEs with plenty of public documentation, making the total analysis time minimal (~2-3 hours). If the CVE you seek lacks public research, [patch analysis](Patch%20Diffing.md) may be your Obi-Wan Kenobi (only hope) for understanding.

This CVE was found from prior reading a security blogs and manually linked to the Windows Print Spooler.

Reading some of the filled in CVE analyses above, you can begin to get a feel for the vulnerabilities within the Windows Printer Spooler.  Looking for patterns within the various sections can help you see clearer. 

### Seeking Patterns in CVE Analysis Templates

Leveraging several **sections** from the template across multiple CVEs, general patterns emerge. 

1. Analyze several CVEs to see what vulnerability classes are lurking in the software you are researching. #fixthisorremove #develop 
3. Generalizations - CVEs that Standardize the way you are looking at CVEs for efficiency and the ability to start to identify patterns.

### Insight 

From the CVE analysis, some general insights emerge:
- The Windows Print Spooler is a popular target because it is running as `SYSTEM` and can easily be interacted with from a standard user via Win32 APIs over RPC.  
- The Windows Printer Spooler performs several privileged file operations and is subject to Time of Check Time of Use Vulnerabilities. 
- The Windows Printer Spooler is also subject to network attacks via its HTTP component.

From repeated CVE analysis you can begin to understand the complexity (service,user,network) of this system. The entry points and attack surface (APIs). Clarity about particular security relevant sections (authentication, files writes) start to become clear.  And finally, a general idea about which vulnerability classes (CWEs and more generally TOCTOU, race condition).

### Getting to the Root Cause

As you approach the Root Cause section of the [Template for CVE analysis](Templates/Template%20for%20CVE%20analysis.md), there are several things to keep in mind. The idea is to determine the underlying security issue that caused the vulnerability. Sometimes this is clear from the various blog post and CVE writeups what the root cause is, other times clarity will only come from [Patch Diffing](Patch%20Diffing.md). It's best to get a good understanding of [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md) to position ourselves to either find other ways to reach the vulnerability.

#### Fundamental Issue / Root Cause Section

>Armchair theorizing, armchair philosophizing, or armchair scholarship is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing)  #removethis?

Understanding the fundamental issue gives us a stepping stone to the reason as to why any particular CVE exists in the first place.  Until the root issue is addressed,**security remains a concern**.  In this section of the template, initially provide an [armchair theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing) about the fundamental issue. There is a bit of a chicken and egg situation here, you can't really know the root issue until you dig a little deeper.  To dig a little deeper an analyst can apply both [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md) and  further clarify with [Patch Diffing](Patch%20Diffing.md). 


#### Best Fit Vulnerability Class (or CWE) Section

*Best fit vulnerability class* is the main category that the particular CVE instance aligns with. Sometimes a vulnerability can span multiple, but that can be fleshed out in the summary and previous section. The idea behind this section is to determine the best fit. For those with more experience, a simple "use-after-free" reference might be enough. The novice researcher would do best to take a look at the [CWE](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md) list, providing some rails on which to categorize the particular CVE. Arguably, this practice can help form links to new ideas about vulnerabilities (Vulnerability Class ideation) and increase overall comprehension.  

#### "Is this CVE the Root Cause or a Causal Factor?" Section

The answer to this question is often more subtle than expected.  To really get the root cause, we take a look at [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md) in the next section.

## When to stop

There is no such thing as a perfect analysis. **There isn't enough time or resources to provide complete comprehension.**  It's OK to not fill in the template completely. This process details a repeatable analysis to be applied with consideration to the *time* and *resources* available.

The **hope** is that CVE analysis would be a process to increase comprehension of a specific vulnerability and vulnerability classes, that would lead to further competence in vulnerability research, that would culminate in new discovery and insight.   

```mermaid

graph LR;

A[CVE Analysis] --> B[Comprehension / Familiarity];
B --> C[Competence];
C --> D[Discovery];

```

### Positive Feedback Loop
Ideally, this process puts the researcher into a self-sustaining positive feedback loop that motivates the researcher to enjoy the work, improve competence, and repeat the cycle on their journey from novice to expert. 
```mermaid

graph LR;

A[Postive Experience] --> B[Take On Next Task With Ease];

```

## Next

Next, we will take a look at [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md), to ensure we are asking enough questions to get to the underlying issue.  After that we will then try [Patch Diffing](Patch%20Diffing.md) to fill in some of the gaps and provide further clarity.
