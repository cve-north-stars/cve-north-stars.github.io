# CVE Analysis

CVE analysis is **one road of many** that leads to the identification and comprehension of [vulnerability classes](Vulnerability%20Classes.md) and vulnerability discovery.

## CVE Analysis Strategy

#develop
The analysis of the CVE will grant experience with the specific component that contains the reported vulnerability. As the component in analyzed, it will highlight the current problem and help put you in the context to identify the same problem in in the same component, or within other components within the system. 

The analysis of several CVEs within the same software can help to generalize vulnerability classes within the system.  

> A **vulnerability class** is a set of vulnerabilities that share some unifying commonality pattern or concept that isolates a specific feature shared by several different software flaws

Fundamental understanding of vulnerability classes expands a researchers ability to find similar vulnerabilities in the current context of research and more generally, find the same type of vulnerability in other software.  Vulnerability classes are mental models that help researchers pull out subtle security flaws, providing new lenses by which out of to approach specific auditing endeavors  (tasks?). #fixthis words words words

### The Ideal Process

At a high level, the ideal process is:

### Why use a template?  #develop
1. *Standardization* - A template helps remove the guesswork of analysis. It provides a standard set of concepts and attributes to be aware of during analysis. It helps focus the analysis on a specific set of attributes promoting comprehension. 
2. *Efficiency* - As the process becomes familiar, the speed of analysis increases.  With experience comes the ability to pick out the relevant information. With the prescribed (or another defined template), the concepts to watch for are clear. Analyze several CVEs to see what vulnerability classes are lurking in the software you are researching. #fixthis 
3. Generalizations - CVEs that Standardize the way you are looking at CVEs for efficiency and the ability to start to identify patterns.  
	
With experience comes the ability to pick out the relevant information. 


### Metadata Primer

- **CVE #**:  < CVE-YYYY-#### > 		
- **Related CWE(s)**: <Related Vulnerability Classifications. This is not required, but useful when trying to see patterns.>
-** Related CVE(s)**: < list of CVEs that relate to this instance >

### CWEs??

CWE stands for **common weakness enumeration**.  Yet another community list helping to identify and categorize vulnerabilities. The easiest way to explain the difference is to contrast CWE with CVE. 

A CVE ID (**common vulnerability and exposure**) is an instance of a particular vulnerability. (ie CVE-2020-1048)  A CWE (**common weakness enumeration**) is the category that a vulnerability fits in, it's type or [vulnerability class](Vulnerability%20Classes.md). 

Also, see [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md) for more details. 


### Several Roads to Rome - Other analysis templates

There are alternate templates.  In July of 2020 Googe's Project zero shared a template for root cause analysis. They also keep a spreadsheet to summarize their findings across the years. See [Google's Project Zero Template](Google's%20Project%20Zero%20Template.md). What is most important is that you have a template that works for you. 


## Example CVE analysis

![](Resources/images/cve-analysis-graph.png)


Following along from our [research](Research.md), we will continue looking at CVEs from the *Windows Print Spooler*.  Those linked below provide sample CVE analysis.  Those selected were CVEs with plenty of public documentation, making the total analysis time minimal (~2-3 hours). If the CVE lacks public research, [patch analysis](Patch%20Analysis.md) may be your Obi-Wan Kenobi (only hope) for understanding.

### Template Patterns

Leveraging several **sections** from the template across multiple CVEs, general patterns emerge. 

#### Summary Section

- Arbitrary file write as `SYSTEM` leading to code execution
	- [CVE-2010-2729](CVE-2010-2729.md)
	- [CVE-2020-1048](CVE-2020-1048.md)
	- [CVE-2020-1337](CVE-2020-1337.md)
	- [CVE-2020-17001](CVE-2020-17001.md)
	- [CVE-2021-1678](CVE-2021-1678.md)

#### Security Boundaries Section

- **User** - A user cannot access or tamper with the code and data of another user without being authorized. 
	- [CVE-2010-2729](CVE-2010-2729.md)
	- [CVE-2020-1048](CVE-2020-1048.md)
	- [CVE-2020-1337](CVE-2020-1337.md)
	- [CVE-2020-17001](CVE-2020-17001.md)
	- [CVE-2021-1678](CVE-2021-1678.md)
- **Network boundary** - An unauthorized network endpoint cannot access or tamper with the code and data on a customer’s device.
	- [CVE-2010-2729](CVE-2010-2729.md)
	- [CVE-2021-1678](CVE-2021-1678.md)

#### Requirements Section
- User context - running code as user
- Networked / Shared Printer
- Controlling State 
	- ability to (start/stop/resume print jobs)
	- TOCTOU

### Insight 

From the CVE analysis, some general insights are gained:
- The Windows Print Spooler is a popular target because it is running as `SYSTEM` and can easily be interacted with from a standard user via Win32 APIs and RPC.  
- The Windows Printer Spooler performs several privileged file operations and is subject to Time of Check Time of Use Vulnerabilities. 
- The Windows Printer Spooler is also subject to network attacks via its HTTP component.

From repeated CVE analysis you can begin to understand the complexity (service,user,network) of this system. The entry points and attack surface (APIs). Clarity about particular security relevant sections (authentication, files writes) start to become clear.  And finally, a general idea about which vulnerability classes (CWEs and more generally TOCTOU, race condition).

### Getting to the Root Cause

As you approach the Root Cause section of the [Template for CVE analysis](Templates/Template%20for%20CVE%20analysis.md), there are several things to keep in mind. The idea is to determine the underlying security issue that caused the vulnerability. Sometimes this is clear from the various blog post and CVE writeups what the root cause is, other times clarity will only come from [Patch Analysis](Patch%20Analysis.md). It's best to get a good understanding of [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md) to position ourselves to either find other ways to reach the vulnerability.

#### Fundamental Issue / Root Cause Section

Understanding the fundamental issue gives us a stepping stone to the reason as to why any particular CVE / vulnerability exists in the first place.  Until the root issue is addressed,**security remains a concern**.  In this section, first provide an [armchair theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing) about the fundamental issue.  This can later be clarified during [Patch Analysis](Patch%20Analysis.md). 

>Armchair theorizing, armchair philosophizing, or armchair scholarship is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing)

#### Best Fit Vulnerability Class Section

Best fit vulnerability class is the main category that the particular CVE instance falls into.  Sometimes a vulnerability can span multiple, but that can be fleshed out in the summary and previous section. The idea behind this section is to determine the best fit. For those with more experience, a simple "use-after-free" reference might be enough. The novice researcher would do best to take a look at the [CWE](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md) list, providing some rails on which to categorize the particular CVE. Arguably, this practice can help form links to new ideas about vulnerabilities.

#### "Is this CVE the Root Cause or a Causal Factor?" Section

The answer to this question is often more subtle than expected.  To really get the root cause, we take a look at [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md).

## Analysis Completion
#develop

There is no such thing as a perfect analysis.  There isn't enough time or resources (detailed blog posts, documentation, etc.) to provide perfect understanding each time. This process details a repeatable analysis to provide again, is one#fixthis #wisdom

It's OK to not fill in the template completely.  That is when we will take a look at [Patch Analysis](Patch%20Analysis.md) to hopefully fill in some of the gaps and provide some familiarity with the selected system.  Before we get there, let's take a look at [Environment Setup and Tooling](Environment%20Setup%20and%20Tooling.md) on our current Windows Print Spooler path.
