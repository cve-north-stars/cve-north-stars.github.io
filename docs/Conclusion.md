There have been several Windows Print Spooler CVEs in the past couple of years. Each CVE provides a bit of insight into the security flaws present within the software.  Let **CVEs be your north star** to start to understand the primary security issues with the component you are researching.

While this writing was mostly about Windows, this idea can be applied to other platforms. While patch diffing is mostly useful for for closed source software, it still can be used to give you insight to specific changes across time.

## CVE Analysis In the Light

When there are public security reports, use those via [CVE analysis](CVE-analysis.md) increase your understanding about the vulnerability and try to understand the [root cause](Root-Cause-Analysis.md).  Don't take the report as final though, as code is ever changing. Also, you might be able to see a bit further that the researcher writing the report, or understand ways in which a patch might have not fixed the root cause. This can lead to discovery of new vulnerablities or variants. 

## Patch Diff In the Dark
When there are no public resources, and all you have is a CVE entry, you are not lost.

[Remember](Patch-Diffing.md#benefits) patch diffing is:
- is **a single source of truth** when there is no other information
- **provides clarity** in vulnerability comprehension and discovery
- can be an excellent candidate for **improving your competence** via [deliberate practice](https://fs.blog/2021/04/deliberate-practice-guide/). It is complex and challenging yet tractable with the help of today's [SRE](https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-free/) [tooling](https://ghidra-sre.org/).


### Positive Feedback Loop
Ideally, this process puts the researcher into a self-sustaining positive feedback loop that motivates the researcher to enjoy the work, improve competence, and repeat the cycle on their journey from novice to expert.

This tutorial has covered quite a bit of ground, but yet to cover the discovery of new vulnerabilities. This step is left as an exercise for the reader.  If you are looking for examples of discovery via patch diffing take a look at [Patch Diffing In the Dark](link). There you will see this process applied and how increased understanding of patch diffed CVEs brought about the discovery of new vulnerabilities.
