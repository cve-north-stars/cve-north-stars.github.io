## Vulnerability Classes

> A **vulnerability class** is a set of vulnerabilities that share some unifying commonality pattern or concept that isolates a specific feature shared by several different software flaws

> Essentially a vulnerability class is a mental device to conceptualize software flaws. -TAOSSA

A common vulnerability class might be a [stack overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow) (a buffer trying to hold too much data) or a [use-after-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer) (a pointer to a valid memory locations, that is subsequently freed and used).

There are several sources for lists of classes out there, but the largest one being the [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration list](https://cwe.mitre.org/) .
