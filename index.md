This is an offically-supported, *bare-minimum* template to deploy Just the Docs to GitHub Pages. More specifically, it:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem (pinned to the latest stable)
- uses the new [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-07-27-github-pages-custom-github-actions-workflows-beta/) to deploy to pages

Other than that, you're free to customize this template however you'd like! [Browse our documentation](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) to learn more about how to use the theme!

To get started, just click ["use this template"](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/generate)!
