## Key Results

- Gain familiarity with a selected platform update process, build system, and tooling 
- Improve Reverse Engineering, open source tools (GHIDRA, bindiff, etc.), debugging / use of symbols
- Provides a practical method to hyper focus on a set of CVEs to discover and generalize a  [vulnerability class](Vulnerability%20Classes.md) or [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md)  via [CVE analysis](CVE%20analysis.md). 
- Introduction to [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md)
