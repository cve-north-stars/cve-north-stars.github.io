## Overview 
The purpose of this course is to introduce the skill of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) analysis and binary patch diffing.  The hope is to provide techniques to help familiarize a researcher with a specific software domain, vulnerability classification ideation, and the ability to  chosen topic and eventually map out vulnerability hot spots.  In a way, to treat CVEs as *North Stars* in vulnerability discovery. CVE analysis provides a better understanding of vulnerability classes and problem areas within specific applications. Root cause analysis will determine whether or not a specific security patch was effective, and may hint that there are more vulnerabilities to be discovered. 

**KEY RESULTS**
- Gain familiarity with selected platform update process, build system, tooling. 
- Improve Reverse Engineering, open source tools (GHIDRA, bindiff, etc.), debugging / use of symbols
- Provides a practical method to hyper focus on a Vulnerability Class or CWE via CVE analysis (or maybe hyper focus on a set of CVEs to generalize a VC or CWE? **fix this later**)
- Introduction to Root Causal Analysis

## Course
- [Course Plan](Course%20Plan.md)
- [Research](Research.md)
	- Identify platform
	- Identify CVE(s)
		- Where to find them.
		- Find similar 
- [CVE analysis](CVE%20analysis.md)
	- [Template for CVE analysis](Templates/Template%20for%20CVE%20analysis.md)
	- Example analysis 
- [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md)
	- root vs causal - 
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys
	- practical analysis CVE example - 
		- RCA diagrams
- [Environment Setup and Tooling](Environment%20Setup%20and%20Tooling.md)
	- Ghidra binary diffing
		- https://blog.threatrack.de/2019/10/02/ghidra-patch-diff/
		- https://github.com/threatrack/ghidra-patchdiff-correlator
		- https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/11/hack-galaxy-hunting-bugs-in-samsung.html
	- Finding the binaries to compare
	- Finding the patch
	- Applying the patch
-  [Patch Analysis](Patch%20Analysis.md)
	- Identify changes, robustness of patch
	- Systems affected 	- 
- Analyze Security Patch
	- Does the security patch fix the root cause, band aid or cure?
	- What to do next?
		- Variant analysis
		- Are there other paths that reach this code?
		- Refraction thinking - Does this root cause exist in any other related subsystem?

TODO:
- Make clear: which ones are conceptual/ practical? 
- many details to work out
- determine correct level/scope for course: what is the audience?
