## Overview 
**CVE analysis** provides an opportunity to gain more insight into the vulnerability classes responsible for the security issues within everyday software. Applying **Patch Differential Analysis (Patch Diffing)** to the relevant security updates will provide clarity into security related sections of vulnerable software. Finally, **Root Cause Analysis** will determine whether a specific security patch was effective, and may hint that there are more vulnerabilities ready to be discovered. 

This course introduces the skill of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) analysis and binary patch diffing. The hope is to provide techniques to help familiarize a researcher with a specific software domain, vulnerability classification ideation, and the ability to focus on a chosen topic to eventually map out vulnerability hot spots. To treat **CVEs as North Stars in vulnerability discovery and comprehension**. 

Along the way, this course analyzes [several](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1048) [recent](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1337) [Windows](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-17001) [Print](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1030) [Spooler](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-1678) CVEs that clearly demonstrate the need for understanding the root cause of vulnerabilities when attempting to patch them.  

**Key Objectives**
- Gain familiarity with a selected platform update process, build system, and tooling 
- Improve Reverse Engineering, open source tools (GHIDRA, bindiff, etc.), debugging / use of symbols
- Provides a practical method to hyper focus on a set of CVEs to discover and generalize a  [vulnerability class](Vulnerability%20Classes.md) or [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md)  via [CVE analysis](CVE%20analysis.md). 
- Introduction to [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md)

TODO:
- [ ] Make clear: which ones are conceptual/ practical?  
- [ ] determine correct level/scope for course: what is the audience?
- [ ] remove the personal pronouns found throughout?
- [ ] add back-matter  (links to main page, next page, etc)
- [ ] grammar checks
