## About

- **CVE North Stars Tutorial**: https://cve-north-stars.github.io
- **Blog Post**: https://clearbluejar.github.io/posts/cve-north-stars/

CVE North Stars introduces a method to kickstart vulnerability research by taking advantage of the CVE information freely available (ie public blog posts, Github POCs, CVE Mitre database, etc). A CVE provides a compass of sorts that orients and guides a researcher towards a deeper understanding of the patched vulnerability and its vulnerability class. The idea is to treat **CVEs as North Stars in vulnerability discovery and comprehension**.

This short tutorial walks through practical CVE analysis, binary patch diffing, and root cause analysis. While these techniques for vulnerability research aren't new, this tutorial offers concise collection of practical examples and ideas for leveraging CVEs to get started in your vulnerability research.

**Key Objectives**
- Learn a practical method to focus on a set of CVEs to discover and generalize a [vulnerability class](docs/Resources/Vulnerability-Classes.md) or [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](docs/Resources/CWE-Common-Weakness-Enumeration.md) via [CVE analysis](docs/CVE-analysis.md).
- Gain familiarity with the Microsoft Windows [update process](docs/Security-Patches.md)
- Improve Reverse Engineering and use of open source tools (*Ghidra*, *symchk*, *patch-diff-correlator*, etc.)
- Experience [Patch Diffing](docs/Patch-Diffing.md) With [Ghidra](docs/Ghidra-Patch-Diffing.md)
- Introduction to [Root Cause Analysis](docs/Root-Cause-Analysis.md)
