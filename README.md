## Overview 
This course introduces the skill of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) analysis and binary patch diffing. The hope is to provide techniques to help familiarize a researcher with a specific software domain, vulnerability classification ideation, and the ability to focus on a chosen topic to eventually map out vulnerability hot spots. To treat **CVEs as North Stars in vulnerability discovery and comprehension**. 

**CVE analysis** provides a better understanding of vulnerability classes responsible for problem security areas within vulnerable software. Applying **Patch Differential Analysis (Patch Diffing)** to the CVE relevant security updates will provide more insight into security problem areas. **Root Cause Analysis** will determine whether a specific security patch was effective, and may hint that there are more vulnerabilities ready to be discovered. 

**KEY RESULTS**
- Gain familiarity with a selected platform update process, build system, and tooling 
- Improve Reverse Engineering, open source tools (GHIDRA, bindiff, etc.), debugging / use of symbols
- Provides a practical method to hyper focus on a set of CVEs to discover and generalize a  [vulnerability class](Vulnerability%20Classes.md) or [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md)  via [CVE analysis](CVE%20analysis.md). 
- Introduction to [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md)

## Course
- [Course Plan](Course%20Plan.md)
- [Research](Research.md)
	- Identify platform
	- Identify CVE(s)		
	- Seeking Patterns
- [CVE analysis](CVE%20analysis.md)
	- The Ideal Process
	- [Template for CVE analysis](Templates/Template%20for%20CVE%20analysis.md)
	- Example analysis 
- [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md)
	- Treating the Symptom Rather Than the Cause
	- Formal Process
	- Practical analysis example
- [Security Patches](Security%20Patches.md)
	- Platform Security Updates
	- Finding the relevant patch
	- Finding the binaries to compare
- [Environment Setup and Tooling](Environment%20Setup%20and%20Tooling.md)
	- Binary Diffing Tools 	
-  [Patch Diffing](Patch%20Diffing.md)
	- Applying the patch
	- Identify changes, robustness of patch
	- Systems affected 	- 
- [Ghidra Version Tracking](Ghidra%20Version%20Tracking.md)
- Analyze Security Patch
	- Does the security patch fix the root cause, band aid or cure?
	- What to do next?
		- Variant analysis
		- Are there other paths that reach this code?
		- Refraction thinking - Does this root cause exist in any other related subsystem?
- [Conclusion](Conclusion.md)

TODO:
- [ ] Make clear: which ones are conceptual/ practical?  
- [ ] determine correct level/scope for course: what is the audience?
- [ ] remove the personal pronouns found throughout?
- [ ] add back-matter  (links to main page, next page, etc)
- [ ] grammar checks
