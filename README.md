## Overview 
This course introduces the skill of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) analysis and binary patch diffing. The hope is to provide techniques to help familiarize a researcher with a specific software domain, vulnerability classification ideation, and the ability to focus on a chosen topic to eventually map out vulnerability hot spots. To treat **CVEs as North Stars in vulnerability discovery and comprehension**. 

**CVE analysis** provides an opportunity to gain more insight into the vulnerability classes responsible for the security issues within everyday software. Applying **Patch Differential Analysis (Patch Diffing)** to the relevant security updates will provide clarity into security related sections within the vulnerable software. Finally, **Root Cause Analysis** will determine whether a specific security patch was effective, and may hint that there are more vulnerabilities ready to be discovered. 

**KEY RESULTS**
- Gain familiarity with a selected platform update process, build system, and tooling 
- Improve Reverse Engineering, open source tools (GHIDRA, bindiff, etc.), debugging / use of symbols
- Provides a practical method to hyper focus on a set of CVEs to discover and generalize a  [vulnerability class](Vulnerability%20Classes.md) or [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](CWE%20-%20Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration.md)  via [CVE analysis](CVE%20analysis.md). 
- Introduction to [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md)

	- Example CVE Analysis Summary
- [Root Cause Analysis](Root%20Cause%20Analysis.md)
	- Treating the Symptom Rather Than the Cause
	- Formal Process
	- Practical analysis example
- [Security Patches](Security%20Patches.md)

- [Patch Diffing Applied](Patch%20Diffing%20Applied.md)
	- CVE
- [Patch Analysis](Patch%20Analysis.md)
	- Does the security patch fix the root cause, band aid or cure?
	- What to do next?
		- Variant analysis
		- Are there other paths that reach this code?
		- Refraction thinking - Does this root cause exist in any other related subsystem?
- [Conclusion](Conclusion.md)

TODO:
- [ ] Make clear: which ones are conceptual/ practical?  
- [ ] determine correct level/scope for course: what is the audience?
- [ ] remove the personal pronouns found throughout?
- [ ] add back-matter  (links to main page, next page, etc)
- [ ] grammar checks
