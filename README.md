## Overview 
**CVE analysis** provides an opportunity to gain more insight into vulnerabilities and the vulnerability classes responsible for the security issues within everyday software. Applying **Patch Differential Analysis (Patch Diffing)** to the relevant security updates will provide clarity into security related sections of vulnerable software. Finally, **Root Cause Analysis** will determine whether a specific security patch was effective, and may hint that there are more vulnerabilities ready to be discovered. 

CVE North Stars introduces the skill of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) analysis and binary patch diffing. The hope is to provide techniques to help familiarize a researcher with a specific software domain, vulnerability classification ideation, and the ability to focus on a chosen topic to eventually map out vulnerability hot spots. To treat **CVEs as North Stars in vulnerability discovery and comprehension**. 

Along the way, this course analyzes [several](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1048) [recent](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1337) [Windows](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-17001) [Print](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1030) [Spooler](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-1678) CVEs that clearly demonstrate the need for understanding the root cause of vulnerabilities when attempting to patch them.  

**Key Objectives**
- Gain familiarity with the Microsoft Windows update process, build system, and tooling 
- Improve Reverse Engineering, use of open source tools (*Ghidra*, *symchk*, *patch-diff-correlator*, etc.) and use of symbols
- Teaches a practical method to focus on a set of CVEs to discover and generalize a  [vulnerability class](Vulnerability-Classes.md) or [CWE-Common-Weakness-Enumeration](CWE-Common-Weakness-Enumeration.md)  via [CVE-analysis](CVE-analysis.md). 
- Introduction to [Root-Cause-Analysis](Root-Cause-Analysis.md)
