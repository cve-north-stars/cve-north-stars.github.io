In order to perform patch analysis the following tools and scripts will be used:

- Ghidra
- BinDiff
- patch_extract
- patch_delta

Additionally, the binaries that have been patched will need to be collected for analysis. This looks different across platforms, but the basic idea remains the same.

```mermaid

graph LR;

A[Vulnerable Binary] --patch--> B[Patched Binary];

```
.
The idea is to collect a before and after snapshot of the vulnerable binary, and perform differential analysis. 



## Binary Diffing Tools

There are several options:
- asd
- asdf
- adsf


This article will focus Ghidra and BINDIFF
