# Patch Diffing Analysis



# start with outline (copy/paste it here)


## Why again?

Closed vs open source. Need for patch diffing. 


### Alternative - Identify a Patch of Interest 
#develop 
- Going from the KB article with patch detail to a particular CVE. 
- Useful for the latter step of finding the patched binary [Environment Setup and Tooling](Environment%20Setup%20and%20Tooling.md)

Notes: 


### show mermaid where patch analysis comes in to help system comprehension and security patch effectiveness evaluation


## Process

- [Patch Diffing with Ghidra (threatrack.de)](https://blog.threatrack.de/2019/10/02/ghidra-patch-diff/#finding-the-patch)
	- finish with prescribed correlator
	- 

1. import first binary, analyze (get symbols first)
2. import 2nd binary, anaylze (get symbols first)
3. Load up version tracking (used to upgrade markup, now for patch diffing)
4. Run this sequence of correlators

## Example

`IsSpoolerImpersonating` - find this during the patch diff.
	- Base -> Specific Patch
	- Base -> n-1 -> Specific Patch
	- ### how to find the n-1?


# Reason why patch wasn't robust

Cost benefit analysis. Sometimes the cure is more painful than the cost.  several competing priorities.
