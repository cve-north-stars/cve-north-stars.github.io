# Root Cause Analysis

>In [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), **root cause analysis** (**RCA**) is a method of [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving") used for identifying the [root causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause "Root cause") of faults or problems.

Root cause analysis is used to find the root causes of faults or problems.  RCA applied to CVE analysis process provides understanding to the underlying security issue. 

## Treating the Symptom rather than the Cause

Often times when we try to solve problems, we are just treating symptoms. 

- Mowing over weeds, instead of pulling out the root
- Taking pain medication, instead of curing the infection
- Replacing a fuse, instead of finding the short

It places us in an endless cycle of treating symptoms, or worse ending in a complete failure of the system we are treating.

graph LR; 
	A[Problem] --> B[Treat Symptom];
	B --> A;

```

To break that loop, the root needs to be identified. 

The main point is to understand the difference between the actual *root cause* and *causal factors* (as listed in the [CVE analysis template](Templates/Template%20for%20CVE%20analysis.md)):
- *root cause* - the fundamental issue. Removing this prevents the problem from recurring
- *casual factors* - A contributor to the issue. Removing this might mitigate some part of the problem, but does not completely remove the issue. 

## Formal Process

RCA - The process to find the root cause of a particular problem.

Four basic steps:
- Identify and describe the problem clearly.
- Establish a timeline from the normal situation up to the time the problem occurred.
- Distinguish between the root cause and other causal factors (e.g., using event correlation).
- Establish a causal graph between the root cause and the problem.

The high level of the process to this:

	A[Apparent Problem] --> B[Symptom of Problem];
	A --> C[Symptom of Problem];
	A --> D[Symptom of Problem];
	B --> E[Possible Root Cause]
	B --> F[Possible Root Cause]
	C --> G[Possible Root Cause]
	D --> H[Possible Root Cause]
	D --> I[Possible Root Cause]
	G --> J[Actual Root Cause]
```


### Alternative - Five Whys

Another process to aid in root cause determination is a technique.   #develop 

## RCA applied to the Windows Print Spooler CVEs

Four basic steps:
- Identify and describe the problem clearly.
- Establish a timeline from the normal situation up to the time the problem occurred.
	- lifetime of spooler or CVE reports, trends
	- grouping related CVEs
- Distinguish between the root cause and other causal factors (e.g., using event correlation).
- Establish a causal graph between the root cause and the problem.

## Updated Ideal CVE Analysis Process

#develop 

Understanding the root of the issue can help us see further. It can generate new ideas for vulnerabilities or alternate paths to get to the root cause in the case the underlying issue still exists.
