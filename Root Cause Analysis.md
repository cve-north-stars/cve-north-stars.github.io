# Root Cause Analysis

## Formal Process

The process to find the root cause of a particular problem.

Four basic steps:
- Identify and describe the problem clearly.
- Establish a timeline from the normal situation up to the time the problem occurred.
- Distinguish between the root cause and other causal factors (e.g., using event correlation).
- Establish a causal graph between the root cause and the problem.

It is important to understand the difference between:
- *root cause* - the fundamental issue. Removing this prevents the problem from recurring
- *casual factors* - A contributor to the issue. Removing this might mitigate some part of the problem, but does not completely remove the issue.

Do this:
```mermaid
graph TD;
 
 classDef default font-size: 12px,stroke-width: 2;
 



	A[Apparent Problem] --> B[Symptom of Problem];
	A --> C[Symptom of Problem];
	A --> D[Symptom of Problem];
	B --> E[Possible Root Cause]
	B --> F[Possible Root Cause]
	C --> G[Possible Root Cause]
	D --> H[Possible Root Cause]
	D --> I[Possible Root Cause]
	G --> J[Actual Root Cause]
```



## Treating the Symptom rather than the Cause

Often times when we try to solve problems, we are just treating symptoms. 

- Mowing over weeds, instead of pulling out the root
- Taking pain medication, instead of curing the infection
- Replacing a fuse, instead of finding the short

It places us in an endless cycle of treating symptoms, or worse ending in a complete failure of the system we are treating.

```mermaid
graph LR; 
	A[Problem] --> B[Treat Symptom];
	B --> A;

```

## Applying RCA to Vulnerability Comprehension

Understanding the root of the issue can help us see further. It can generate new ideas for vulnerabilities or alternate paths to get to the root cause in the case the underlying issue still exists.
