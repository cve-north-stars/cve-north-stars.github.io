# P- Patch Diffing - Leveraging CVE Analysis to Kickstart your Vulnerability Hunting Adventure


**OBJECTIVE**
- Leverage the skill of security patch diffing to analyze and understand recent vulnerabilities (CVEs) in order to determine if a software security patch fixed the root cause, or just a causal factor. 

**KEY RESULTS**
- Gain familiarity with selected platform update process, build system, tooling. 
- Improve Reverse Engineering, open source tools (GHIDRA, diaphora, etc.), debugging / use of symbols
- Provides a practical method to hyper focus on a CWE via CVE analysis
- Introduction to Root Causal Analysis

# Course
- Research 
	- Identify platform
	- Identify CVE(s)
		- Where to find them.
		- Find similar 
	- CVE analysis template
- Environment Setup / Tooling
	- Ghidra binary diffing
		- https://blog.threatrack.de/2019/10/02/ghidra-patch-diff/
		- https://github.com/threatrack/ghidra-patchdiff-correlator
	- Finding the binaries to compare
	- Finding the patch
	- Applying the patch
- Patch Analysis 
	- Identify changes, robustness of patch
	- Systems affected 	- 
- Root Cause Analysis
	- root vs causal - 
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys
	- practical analysis CVE example - 
		- RCA diagrams
- Analyze Security Patch
	- Does the security patch fix the root cause, band aid or cure?
	- What to do next?
		- Variant analysis
		- Are there other paths that reach this code?
		- Refraction thinking - Does this root cause exist in any other related subsystem?

TODO:
- Make clear: which ones are conceptual/ practical? 
- many details to work out
- determine correct level/scope for course: what is the audience?
